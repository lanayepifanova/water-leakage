Data that can be used 
1. Sentinel-2 data 
L1C = 生データ（見た目重視）
L2A = 補正済みデータ（分析・研究・水質向き）
  measures reflected light intensity from sunlight 
    vegetation health 
    quality of water bodies (sediment, algal blooms)-> would be cool if we could measure lead levels through satellite tech 
    soil moisture 
    land cover classification 
2. Sentinel-1 data
  actively emits radar pulses and measures how they bounce back from earth's surface 
    oil spills
