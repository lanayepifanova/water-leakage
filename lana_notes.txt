multispectral - using many different types of data sources

WADI (water distribution system anomaly detection) = research benchmark

step 0
- choose a pilot area with some break/repair records (20-200 events)
- choose a known main corridor

step 1
- build the "corridor mask"
- create a buffer around known pipe alignments (10-50m rural)
- if pipe routes aren't public,  you can start with trunk mains, canal/aqueduct alignments, or approximate right-of-way corridors

step 2 
- pull imagery time series (use Google Earth Engine)
- for each corridor segment, create a time series of
  - Sentinel-2 indices (NDVI/NDWI/red-edge)
  - Sentinel-1 VV/VH + coherence (optional)
  - thermal anomaly metric (optional)

step 3
- turn it into anomaly scores
- for each pixel/segment
  - build a seasonal baseline (same month across prior years)
  - computer z score or percentile anomalies
  - aggregate to the corridor (top-k anomaly pixels per 100m)

step 4
- train a first model
- if you have leak points + data, create training chips (64x64 or 128x128) around leak points and matched "non-leak" controls nearby
- use either gradient boosted trees/random forset on aggregated features (fast + interpretable)
- or a small CNN/U-Net on multi-band stacks

## the data problem and data labels ##
- start with unsupervised anomaly detection
- "find persistent wet/veg/thermal anomalies along pipeline corridors"
- treat outputs as inspection candidates, not definitive leaks
- use city/utility open data
- use press releases and incident logs for major breaks
- use hydrant flow and pressure district events

## satellite signals we can use ##

sentinel-2 data
- picks up wet oil changes, vegetation response
- features to computer include NDVI, NDWI, and red edge vegetation
- how the earth's surface reflects sunlight in multiple wavelengths across 13 different spectral bands (visible light + invisible light)
- it measures reflected light intensity which reveals physical and biological properties of the surface
- visible light: blue, green, and red bands
- near infrared (NIR) + red edge: great at detecting vegetation health, leaf area, chlorophyll content, biomass, plant stress, crop vigor
- short wave infrared (SWIR): moisture content in soil and vegetation
- can derive: vegetation health, water bodies, water quality, soil moisture, land cover classification

sentinel-1 data
- picks up moisutre + backscatter changes, coherence changes, and tiny ground deformation
- InSAR time series deformation, backscatter (VV/VH), coherence, multi temporal change metrics
- synthetic aperature radar (SAR) satellite consetellation
- actively emits radar pulses and measure how they bounce back from Earth's surface
- surface roughness & texture, ground motion & deformation called Interferometric SAR, oil spills, sea icea extent and motion, ship detection
- level 0 = raw radar data
- level 1 SLC = complex images with amplitude and phase
- level 1 GRD = radar intensity images projected to ground
- level 2 = higher level geophysical products

thermal (landsat/ECOSTRESS) data
- picks up temperature anomalies consistent with evaporative cooling from wet fround
