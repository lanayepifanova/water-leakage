multispectral - using many different types of data sources

WADI (water distribution system anomaly detection) = research benchmark

## satellite signals we can use ##

sentinel-2 data
- how the earth's surface reflects sunlight in multiple wavelengths across 13 different spectral bands (visible light + invisible light)
- it measures reflected light intensity which reveals physical and biological properties of the surface
- visible light: blue, green, and red bands
- near infrared (NIR) + red edge: great at detecting vegetation health, leaf area, chlorophyll content, biomass, plant stress, crop vigor
- short wave infrared (SWIR): moisture content in soil and vegetation
- can derive: vegetation health, water bodies, water quality, soil moisture, land cover classification

sentinel-1 data
- synthetic aperature radar (SAR) satellite consetellation
- actively emits radar pulses and measure how they bounce back from Earth's surface
- surface roughness & texture, ground motion & deformation called Interferometric SAR, oil spills, sea icea extent and motion, ship detection
- level 0 = raw radar data
- level 1 SLC = complex images with amplitude and phase
- level 1 GRD = radar intensity images projected to ground
- level 2 = higher level geophysical products
